# About
There's a lot of spare time that I've run into while fixing phones at iFixYouri, so I figured why not make an app for the place and see what happens?

# References
Libraries used in this project include:

SwiftyJSON (json parser)
Alamofire (networking)
EZSwiftExtensions (useful functions for Swift)
PMSuperButton (button-styling library)
